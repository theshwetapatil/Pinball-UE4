BLUEPRINTS
Types of Blueprint scripts: Construction Scirpt and Event Grpah
Construction Scirpt handles all the things one would want to run when the Blueprint class is created.
Event Graph contains all the code related to the gameplay events. It used in most cases when making something in blueprint.
Within Event Graph: Begin Play and Tick
Begin Play is the event that fires the moment game begins or actor enters the already running gameplay.
Tick functions runs once per frame, per actor. Can be disabled.
After Begin Play has run, Tick runs. Every single frame, every time the PC is updated, it Ticks every actor again and again and again.
**********Time between Ticks, time between computer updating all of the actors again and again is called the Delta Time. 
Time gap between two Ticks is represented by Delta Seconds variable, in Event Graph.
Delta Second is of float type.
Velocity change in Impuse says ignore any actual mass of the object and move it at the given speed.
--------------------
Line Check is done to check what's beneath the ball itself.
Line Trace- Whenever something hits between start position and end position, it returns a value to inspect it more closely and get information from it.
Line Trace has to be started from Actor's[In this case, Ball's] current position.
****Within Unreal, X-Forwards, Y-Sideways, Z-Up and Down
After collision with ground, all the Break Hit Result information can be obtained.
Select and CTR+W- To duplicate cell in Event Graph
In Material, Hold V+Left-Click to create Vector Parameter.
For the player character, there are normally aspects: Controller and Pawn
Controller kinda refers to the brain of the object. In the context of player, controller handles all of the inputs.
Pawn is kinda like the body of the object.
Controller sends messages to the pawn and the pawn knows what to do.
Player pawn is not required for a Pinball game.
For Camera, Auto Player Activation is set to Player 0.
--------------------
For Bumpers, new blueprint needs to be created.
Two meshes required for Bumpers: Bump Mechanism and Pop Bumper Base
*******Imapct Normal, under Break Hit Result is the direction in world space of the trace test.
To set the Collision of BumperMesh, three types of colliders are added: Thin capsule on the inside, around the top, and the overlap region.
Whenever the ball enters overlap region, bumper gets activated.
When something overlaps the given region, check whether it's a Ball.
Blueprint of Bumper::
Cast to <Anything> tries to verify that it is that kinda object that's being read into it.
Add Capsule Collision in the viewport.
Sound, Movement, Material and Light needs to be added for more effectiveness.
In Material window, Hold T+Left-Click to create Texture node
In Material window, Hold L+Left-Click to create Lerp(Linear Interpolation) node
Create a Custom Event- Bump.
In Material window, Hold M+Left-Click to create Multiply node
In Material window, Hold S+Left-Click to create Scalar Parameter node
It looks nice but reasonably subtle, when something is lighting up beneath the surface, to have a rather smooth level of roughness.
Make sure by default, Emissive Boost is set to 0.
Component changes and Adding lights is next.
