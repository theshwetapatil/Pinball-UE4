BLUEPRINTS
Types of Blueprint scripts: Construction Scirpt and Event Grpah
Construction Scirpt handles all the things one would want to run when the Blueprint class is created.
Event Graph contains all the code related to the gameplay events. It used in most cases when making something in blueprint.
Within Event Graph: Begin Play and Tick
Begin Play is the event that fires the moment game begins or actor enters the already running gameplay.
Tick functions runs once per frame, per actor. Can be disabled.
After Begin Play has run, Tick runs. Every single frame, every time the PC is updated, it Ticks every actor again and again and again.
**********Time between Ticks, time between computer updating all of the actors again and again is called the Delta Time. 
Time gap between two Ticks is represented by Delta Seconds variable, in Event Graph.
Delta Second is of float type.
