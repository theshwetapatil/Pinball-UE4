BLUEPRINTS
Types of Blueprint scripts: Construction Scirpt and Event Grpah
Construction Scirpt handles all the things one would want to run when the Blueprint class is created.
Event Graph contains all the code related to the gameplay events. It used in most cases when making something in blueprint.
Within Event Graph: Begin Play and Tick
Begin Play is the event that fires the moment game begins or actor enters the already running gameplay.
Tick functions runs once per frame, per actor. Can be disabled.
After Begin Play has run, Tick runs. Every single frame, every time the PC is updated, it Ticks every actor again and again and again.
**********Time between Ticks, time between computer updating all of the actors again and again is called the Delta Time. 
Time gap between two Ticks is represented by Delta Seconds variable, in Event Graph.
Delta Second is of float type.
Velocity change in Impuse says ignore any actual mass of the object and move it at the given speed.

Line Check is done to check what's beneath the ball itself.
Line Trace- Whenever something hits between start position and end position, it returns a value to inspect it more closely and get information from it.
Line Trace has to be started from Actor's[In this case, Ball's] current position.

For the player character, there are normally aspects: Controller and Pawn
Controller kinda refers to the brain of the object. In the context of player, controller handles all of the inputs.
Pawn is kinda like the body of the object.
Controller sends messages to the pawn and the pawn knows what to do.
Player pawn is not required for a Pinball game.
